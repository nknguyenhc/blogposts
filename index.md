## Why Christianity

<box type="tip">

**John 16:33**

I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

Hope has a name: Jesus. Jesus is the only way to the Father. In him we have hope: against evil, tribulation, sufferings, what awaits us at the end is union with God.

Being Christian is to have hope. With this hope, we perservere in our loyalty to God.

**James 1:12**

Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him.
