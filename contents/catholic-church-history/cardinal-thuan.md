## Overview

Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan, or Cardinal Thuan for short, was arrested for 13 years without trial. Even in hardship, he still carried out his apostolic duties in prison, with an optimistic mindset. His life is a testimony of hope and faith in God.

Cardinal Thuan has been named as Venerable, a significant step towards canonization.

## Historical context

On 30 Apr 1975, the communist North took over the South, effectively reunite the country of Vietnam. While the communist government did not ban religious activities, many could be seen as plotting against the government. Catholics, including priests and bishops, are vulnerable targets.

Immediately after reunification, the government opened many re-education camps, where past South Vietnam soldiers and past South Vietnam government officials were sent into. The camps were meant to "re-educate" inmates with communist ideologies, ensuring their loyalty towards the communist government.

The Vietnamese government was not particularly fond of Catholicism. Evidently, the Apostolic Delegate Henri Lemaitre in Vietnam was expelled from the country. [[ref]](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/06/archives/vatican-aide-in-saigon-leaves-under-criticism.html)

## Arrest

On 24 Apr 1975, pope Paul VI appointed Francis Thuan, previously bishop of Nha Trang, to be vice-archbishop of Saigon. There were plans for bishop Francis Thuan to, in future, inherit the title of archbishop of Saigon.

However, soon after the country's reunification, many opposed the appointment of Francis Thuan in Saigon. It was seen as too risky of a move. Furthermore, Francis Thuan was a nephew of Ngo Dinh Diem, the first president of the former South Vietnam. The appointment would be seen as a plot by the Vatican and Catholics against the government.

Unexpectedly, on 26 Jun 1975, the military administration committee issued a decree banning Francis Thuan’s religious activities in Saigon, ordering him to go back to Nha Trang.

On 15 Aug 1975, Francis Thuan was arrested and sent to a re-education camp. He was transported from Saigon back to the re-education camp in Nha Trang, where he used to preside over as bishop.

## In jail

Being put in jail could not stop Thuan from being a disciple of God. But it was not always smooth from the beginning.

In jail, he wrote two of his best books: the Road of Hope, and Five Loaves and Two Fish. The former consists of 1001 of his reflections, while the latter largely draws from his experience in jail. I present to you the content of the latter book, while drawing relevant parts from the former book.

The books are available here, in Vietnamese.

- [Five Loaves and Two Fish](https://suyniemhangngay.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/N%C4%82M-CHI%E1%BA%BEC-B%C3%81NH-V%C3%80-HAI-CON-C%C3%81-%C4%90HY-Nguy%E1%BB%85n-V%C4%83n-Thu%E1%BA%ADn.pdf)

### Choose God, not works for God

Before being imprisoned, Thuan was very active in his ministry: educating seminarians, training youths, teaching catechisms, etc. They were what he was really passionate about.

Then came his arrest. He no longer could carry out his diocesan work. It did not help when the re-education camp he was in was very near his past bishop office in Nha Trang. It gave him the most desparate feeling when he was right near his church, right near his bishop office. Yet, he could not be there to build the Church, to guide Catholics on the new chapter of his country.

But a voice came from inside his mind,

> “Tại sao con quẫn trí, hoang mang như thế làm gì? Con phải biết phân biệt giữa Chúa và công việc của Chúa. Những gì con đã làm và tiếp tục làm như kinh lý giáo phận, huấn luyện nam nữ tu sĩ, giáo dân, thanh niên, kiến thiết thánh đường, cư xá sinh viên, mở mang các thí điểm truyền giáo... tất cả những công tác ấy đều là những việc tốt lành, là việc của Chúa, nhưng không phải là Chúa! Nếu Chúa muốn con trao tất cả các việc ấy trong tay Ngài, con hãy làm ngay, và hãy tin tưởng vào Ngài. Chúa có thể làm tốt hơn con muôn nghìn lần; Ngài có thể trao việc của Ngài cho những người tài đức hơn con. Hãy chọn một mình Chúa thôi, chọn thánh ý Ngài, chứ đừng chọn việc của Chúa!”
>
> “Why are you so troubled and confused? You must distinguish between God and the works for God. All that you have done and want to continue to do, such as pastoral visits, training seminarians, Catholics, young people, building schools, dormitories, churches, evangelical points, etc, all are good and are works for God, but not God himself! If God wants those back from you, you have to give up all those, and trust him. God can do those a thousand times better than you, and God will entrust your work to someone else more capable. You must choose God, choose his will, not the works of God!”

And he found peace in what was said.

There were days that he was in absolute darkness, and there was only a small hole with light coming in, he placed his nose there to breathe. Sometimes insects came in, there were worms, long worms crawling around. But he was too weak to do anything about it.

Two other priests recounted what happened to him: a nurse brought them to him and said, “I let two of you see Thuan, he is already about to die!” But in this hardship, God has saved him.

So, perhaps God's will was for him to do something else in prison. But what could it be?

### Live the moment

He recounted what bishop John Walsh said when being released after 12 years of prison, "I have spent half of my life waiting." Yes, prisoners, including himself, await freedom every second. But, recounting what he had always been telling himself since his time as a seminarian,

> “Nếu tôi mất giờ đợi chờ, không làm gì hết, biết đâu những điều tôi đợi sẽ không bao giờ đến. Chỉ có một điều, dù không đợi cũng vẫn đến, đó là sự chết!”
>
> "If I waste time waiting, doing nothing, what if what I am waiting for will never come. There is only one thing, even if I do not wait for, will definitely come, and that is death!"

And so, he did not wait.

> Tôi không đợi chờ. Tôi sống phút hiện tại và làm cho nó đầy tình thương.
>
> I do not wait. I live the present moment and make it full of love.

But he did not know what to do. He could not carry out his apostolic duties like how it was before he was arrested. A voice from inside told him, he could learn from St Paul. When St Paul was in jail, he could not carry out his apostolic duties, so he wrote letters to his dioceses. "It is as simple as that, what complicated thoughts are you having?"

That was how the book "the Road of Hope" was written! The book has now been published in eight languages.

The next morning, just at dawn, in mid-October 1975, he signalled a 7-year-old boy named Quang, who just came out of the 5 AM mass, when it was still foggy and cold: “Quang! Go home and tell your mother to buy you some old calendar blocks, I need them.” In the evening, he brought the old calendar blocks. So every night in October and November 1975, Thuan closed all the doors, took cement paper and stuck it inside, and wrote “Messages from prison” for his parishioners, under the flickering oil lamp, mosquitoes biting. Everyday in the early morning, he gave Quang the calendar pages he had written on the back, so that he would bring them back to his brothers and sisters to copy so they wouldn't get lost.

What can we learn from him?

Teresa Calcutta has one sent a letter to him, saying,

> “Điều quan trọng không phải là số công tác đã thực hiện nhưng là mức độ tình yêu ta đã để vào mỗi công việc.”
>
> “What matters is not the amount of work done but the amount of love we put into each task.”

Live every moment like it is the last. Every word, every thought, every action, every phone call, etc, all has to be the best in life. Do not regret any moment in life as though one has not done enough.

### Prayers

It was hard in prison. Time passes by really slowly during solitary confinement. Our ancestors had said in the proverbs: “Nhất nhật tại tù, thiên thu tại ngoại”, or “one day in prison, [equals] thousands of years in freedom.”

Sometimes he was too weak to just pray one full prayer. Then he remembered Jim’s story. [[ref]](https://boozejoyce.wordpress.com/2022/01/17/jims-story/)

Everyday at 12PM, the old Jim comes to the church to pray with a simple prayer, "Jesus, it's Jim." At one point, Jim fell ill and was hospitalised. In his ward, when he arrived, slowly but surely, things changed. Men stopped grumbling, and were cheerful and content. The hospital staff members were very surprised, and asked him what made him so happy. Jim said, it was his visitors that made him happy. But the staff saw no one. Who could it be? Everyday at 12PM, the visitor came to his side, and said, "Jim, it's Jesus."

Prayer is not a matter of fancy words. It is our desires expressed to God. It is supposed to bring change to others.

Mother Mary reminded him to pray through a communist. Mr Hai was in the same cell as him to spy on him, later on they became friends. Hai said, his house was only 3 km away from La Vang, he could go to La Vang to pray to mother Mary for him. He believed in his honesty, but doubted that a communist would pray to mother Mary for him.

For a bit of context, La Vang was where mother Mary appeared to Catholics in hiding in forest, in around 1800, when Catholics were under persecution by king Canh Thinh of Tay Son dynasty. Mother Mary appeared in the traditional Vietnamese costume ao dai, with baby Jesus in her arms. While the forest presented many dangers to those running away, mother Mary taught them to boil a specific kind of leave to cure diseases, and protected them from dangers. The series of apparition became well known, and a church was built to commemorate the event. [[ref]](https://cathedralokc.org/c-m-lavang)

Later, shortly after Hai and Thuan parted ways, Thuan received a letter from Hai.

> “Anh Thuận thân mến, tôi đã hứa với anh, tôi sẽ đi cầu nguyện Đức Mẹ La Vang cho anh. Mỗi Chủ nhật, nếu trời không mưa, lúc nghe chuông La Vang, tôi lấy xe đạp vào trước đài Đức Mẹ, vì chiến tranh bom đạn đã đánh sập nhà thờ rồi. Tôi cầu nguyện thế này: Thưa Đức Mẹ, tôi không có đạo, tôi không thuộc kinh nào cả. Nhưng tôi đã hứa sẽ đi cầu nguyện Đức Mẹ cho anh Thuận, nên tôi đến đây. Xin Đức Mẹ biết anh Thuận cần gì thì cho anh ấy”
>
> “Dear Thuan, I have promised you that I would go to pray to Our Lady of La Vang for you. Every Sunday, if it does not rain, when I hear the La Vang bell, I ride my bike to Mary’s statue, because the war bombs have destroyed the church. I prayed like this: Dear Mary, I am not Christian, I don’t know any prayer. But I have promised to come here to pray for Thuan, so here I am. Please be aware of what Thuan wants and grant his wish.”

### The Eucharist

Even under the strict monitoring of the re-education camps, Thuan managed to carry out the Eucharist. Where did he get the bread and wine to consecrate? In his letters to the outside, he wrote, "please send me some wine, the medicine to treat the gut"

The people receiving his message understood what he meant. They sent him a small bottle with unleavened bread and wine, outside with the sticker “medicine to treat the gut”. This passed the security checks.

In the bunker inside the boat moving him to the North, he used bags as the altar to conduct mass. In camp, initially he conducted mass when people were bathing after morning exercise. Then, when he has been familiar with the schedule in the reeducation camps, at night, inmates were divided into groups of 50. In his group, people tried to arrange such that there were at least 5 Catholics besides him. At 9:30PM, when the lights were off, he conducted mass, and distributed the Eucharist under the anti-mosquito nets. They made small paper bags by reusing cigarette covers, to keep the Eucharist. Jesus was always with us. We believed in a power: the Eucharist. The body and blood of Christ kept us alive: I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. (**John 10:10**)

And all of that effort to keep the Eucharist was not in vain. They managed to see a lot of miracles.

At night, inmates adore the Eucharist. With the silent presence, Jesus Christ made many miracles. Many Catholics came back to faith enthusiastically. Their testimony of love and service had a great impact on other inmates. Even many Buddhists and agnostics converted into the faith. The power of Jesus’ love is irresistible. And so the darkness of night became the light of Easter, the seed has been sown in the middle of a storm. Prison became a school for catechism. Catholics conducted baptism for fellow inmates, becoming their godparents.

Jesus fed the people who followed Him in the desert, and in the Eucharist, Jesus continued to be the food for eternal life.

> Mỗi lúc dâng lễ, đọc lời truyền phép, với tất cả tâm hồn, tôi làm lại lời “giao ước mới, giao ước vĩnh cửu” với Chúa Giêsu. Không phải để sống an nhàn, nhưng để bắt đầu một cuộc cách mạng, đổi mới nhân loại, được máu Chúa cứu chuộc, sống xứng đáng phẩm giá con Thiên Chúa, trong văn hóa của tình thương và sự sống. Trong Thánh Thể chúng tôi loan truyền sự chết của Chúa Giêsu và tuyên xưng sự sống lại của Ngài.
>
> Everytime I celebrate mass, recite the words of consecration, with all my soul, I renew the words of the new, eternal covenant with Jesus. Not to live in comfort, but to start a new revolution, to renew humanity, redeemed by the blood of Christ, live worthy of the dignity of children of God, in the culture of love and life. In the Eucharist we proclaim the death of Jesus and his resurrection.

### Love

<box type="tip">

**John 13:34-35**

A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

</box>

To be a witness of the Gospel is to do the above.

One time, he was in great pain, and he told a warden, "I am in pain, please take pity on me and give me some medicine." He replied, "There is no love/pity here, only duties." That was how is was in prison.

But that was not the case all the time. There was a period where, they had to rotate the guard team once, so as not to be "poisoned" by him. After a while, they stopped, as the superiors were afraid that the whole department would be poisoned. In reality, they were only allowed to reply him with "yes" or "no", nothing else, so as to avoid being poisoned. It was as if he was labelled with "treason" that they hated him so much.

Not deterred, a voice in his head told him,

> "Tại sao con dại thế? Con còn giàu lắm: Con mang tình thương Chúa Giêsu trong tim con. Hãy yêu thương họ như Chúa Giêsu đã yêu con"
>
> "Why are you so foolish? You are really rich: you carry the love of Jesus in your heart. Love them as Jesus has loved you."

So he started to open up with the wardens. He talked about his past experience in other countries like Canada, Japan, Phillipines, Singapore, France, Germany, Australia, Austria, etc, prompting them to enquire and ask him questions. Many of them wanted to learn foreign languages, he helped them. Even the superiors started to send their people to learn with him.

<box type="tip">

**John 25, 39**

Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.

</box>

During one of his conversations with a superior, the superior asked Thuan about his opinion on a Catholic news outlet, "Người Công giáo". And he said, there needs to be more conversations between Catholics and non-Catholics, to foster understanding. And so, Thuan agreed to write a "lexicon" in multiple languages, French, English, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, to explain Catholic terms, differences between Catholicism and Protestanism and Orthodox, as well as other Catholic matters such as finance of the Church, priesthood, relation between the Church and the people, etc. Many were open to conversation and understanding.

At one time, there were 20 young soldiers learning Latin so as to read Catholic documents. One of them asked Thuan to teach him a song in Latin. He offered many songs, and he chose, Veni Creator, which means prayer for Holy Trinity to come. He was moved that a communist fellow sung the song in a communist jail. Another one chose the song, "in rememberance of Thomas Thien." Thomas Thien was one of the Vietnamese martyrs canonized as saint.

**He earned the trust of many wardens.**

He once requested for a piece of wood, for him to cut it into a cross. The rule in the camp forbids any religious relics. But because he was friend with the warden, they agreed to keep it secret, and the warden passed a piece of wood to him.

In another instance, he requested for a copper wire. The wardens were taught, any inmate that wants to keep a copper wire is planning to suicide. But of course, priests are the least likely to do so. So Thuan explained to the warden, he wanted to make a chain to carry the cross. The warden was hesitant due to how risky it could be. They eventually agreed to keep it secret, and the warden gave him 3 hours and a clipper to finish his job. Thuan managed to finish.

The cross was not to remind him of the prison days, but to remind him that,

> Không phải dùng khí giới, đe dọa, áp lực mà có thể thay đổi được lòng người; chỉ có tình yêu Chúa Giêsu mới thay đổi được.
>
> It is not by weapons, threats, or pressure that can change people's hearts; only the love of Jesus can do that.

Many wardens were perplexed by his attitude towards them, who should have been seen as enemies. And his reply was,

> Vì Chúa Giêsu đã dạy tôi yêu thương; nếu tôi không tuân giữ, tôi không đáng gọi là Kitô hữu nữa
>
> For Jesus has taught me to love; if I do not keep the commandment, I am no longer worthy to be called a Christian

We as Catholics do not do great works, we are simply instruments of God: just like the boy who had as little as 5 loaves and 2 fish. But that was all it needed, because God did the rest: he multiplied it and fed five thousand people.

### Mother Mary

What he heard in front of Our Lady of Lourdes: “Bernadette, I do not promise you happiness and consolation in this world, but promise you suffering and trials.”

He was frightened, but accepted and entrusted into her hands.

Once he prayed,

> Lạy Mẹ, Mẹ muốn con làm gì cho Mẹ? Con sẵn sàng thi hành mệnh lệnh của Mẹ. Ngày nào Mẹ thấy con không còn ích lợi gì cho Hội Thánh nữa, thì xin Mẹ cho con được ơn chết trong tù. Nếu Mẹ thấy con còn có thể làm được gì cho Hội Thánh thì xin Mẹ cho con được ra khỏi tù vào một trong những ngày lễ kính Mẹ
>
> Mother Mary, what do you want me to do for you? I am ready to carry out your orders. If you think I am no longer of any use for the Church, please let me have the grace to die in jail. But if you think I am of any use for the Church, let me out of jail in one of your celebrations/occasions.

He was out of jail on 21 Nov, 1988: the presentation of the blessed virgin Mary.

- Guard: Thuan, have you eaten lunch?
- Thuan: No, I am cooking
- Guard: Finish your lunch, dress up to meet a government official
- Thuan: Who?
- Guard: I don’t know, I am only following orders.

After lunch, he met Mai Chi Tho, the head of the department for internal affairs.

- Tho: Thuan, have you got any wish?
- Thuan: I want to be freed
- Tho: When?
- Thuan: Today

Mai Chi Tho was baffled. Thuan continued.

- Thuan: I have been through 3 generations of pope: Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II. I have also been through 4 generations of USSR presidents.
- Tho: Right! Right!

Then, turning to his subordinates, Tho said: let Thuan be granted his wish

### Choose God

Many asked him, how can one truly follow God, in this world full of tumult? So here are his 24 stars, each of which is a guide on "one" thing.

1. You want to carry out **one** revolution: to renew the world. That great aspiration, that noble mission, God has assigned you; you carry it out with the "power of the Holy Spirit." Everyday you prepare a new Pentecost.
2. You push for **one** campaign: to make everyone happy. You sacrifice every moment with Jesus, so as to bring peace in mind, growth and prosperity for all races. The path that is secret and practical!
3. You remember **one** apostolic way: "lay down my life for my brothers", because there is no greater love than this (John 15:13). You spend every moment and are ready to spend to win your brothers over to God.
4. You have **one** slogan: "All unity," unity among Catholics, unity among Christians, unity among peoples. As the Father and the Son are one (John 17:22-23)
5. You believe in **one** power: the Eucharist. God's flesh and blood will make you alive, I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. (John 10:10) As manna nourished the Jews on their journey to the promised land, the Eucharist will nourish you on the road of Hope (John 6:53)
6. You wear **one** uniform, speak **one** language: love. By this all men will know that you are God's disciples (John 13:35), an affordable sign yet difficult to find. Love is the one language that St Paul considered superior over language of men and of angels, the only language that will exist in heaven (1 Cor 13:1)
7. You have **one** secret sauce: prayer. No one is stronger than the one that prays, because God has promised to give you everything. When you pray together, God is with you (Matthew 18:20). I strongly advise you, outside of regular prayers, pray everyday for at least one hour, even better two hours. It is not a useless loss! On the road I travelled, I saw the words of St Teresa Avila coming true: "He who does not pray, without the devil's lure, will fall into hell by himself."
8. You keep **one** rule: the Gospel. It is the constitution above all constitutions, the one Jesus left with his apostles (Matthew 4:23). It is a constitution not difficult, complicated, restrictive like other constitutions, on the contrary, it is flexible, kind, and cheers up your soul. A saint outside of the Gospel is a "false saint."
9. You are loyal to **one** leader: Christ, and his vicar, the Pope, the bishops, the successors of the apostles (John 20:22-23). Live and die for the Church like Christ. Do not think that only dying for the Church is a sacrifice. Living for the church also requires a lot of sacrifices.
10. You have **one** love: mother Mary. St John Mary Vianney said: "My first love is Mary." Listening to her will lead you not astray, working for her will not fail, glorifying her will give you eternal life.
11. You have **one** wisdom: the science of the cross (1 Cor 2:2). Looking at Jesus on the cross, you can immediately resolve the problem bothering you. The cross is the standard for making choices and decisions, your soul will be at peace.
12. You have **one** ideal: towards God the Father, a loving Father. Throughout Jesus' life, all of his thoughts and actions were directed towards one direction: "I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father" (John 14:31), "I always do what is pleasing to him" (John 8:29).
13. You have only **one** fear: sin. The court of the Greek emperor convened to discuss how to take revenge on St John Chrysostom because he had firmly reprimanded the queen.

- Plan I: Incarceration. But he would have the opportunity to pray, to suffer for God as he always desired.
- Plan II: Exile. But for him, everywhere is God's land.
- Plan III: Execution. He would be martyred, we would satisfy his desire: to be back with God.

All plans I, II, III would not make him suffer, on the contrary, he would happily accept.

- Plan IV: There is only one thing he fears the most, hates the most, which is sin, but we were unable to force him to commit sin.

If you only fear sin, then no one is stronger than you.

14. You keep **one** wish: "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10). On earth, pagans will know God as in heaven. On earth, people will begin to love one another as in heaven. The earth will begin to fill with joy like heaven. You will strive to make your wish come true. Begin to bring heavenly happiness to everyone right here on earth.
15. You lack only **one** thing: "sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven" (Matthew 16:21), meaning that you must be resolute. God needs those willing to leave and transform.
16. You use **one** effective apostolic method: interact to integrate, become one with everyone to understand, to listen, to love everyone. Interaction is more effective than preaching, than writing books. Interaction between humans, heart to heart, the secret of perseverance, the secret of success.
17. You have only **one** most important thing, and Mary (sister of Martha) has chosen the best part: sitting by the Lord (Luke 10:41-42). If you do not foster your spiritual life, if Jesus is not the soul of your activities, then ... You have seen much, understood much, I need not say more.
18. You have only **one** food: "The will of the Father" (John 4:34), meaning you live and grow by God's will, act according to God's will. God's will is like food that makes you live well and contently; outside of God's will, you die.
19. You have only **one** most beautiful moment: the present moment (Matthew 6:34, James 4:13-15). Live in God's love in its fullest way, and your life will be so beautiful if crystallized by millions of the most beautiful moments. It is simple, not difficult!
20. You have only **one** declaration: "The eight beatitudes." On the mountain, Jesus proclaimed the eight beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12). Live like this, you will taste happiness, and then spread it to everyone you encounter.
21. You have only **one** important job: duty, no matter great or small, because you do the work of your Father in heaven. He has appointed you to carry out His plan in history (Luke 2:49, John 17:4). Fulfilling your duties is the most certain path of spirituality. Many people draw up a complicated path of spirituality, and then complain that it is difficult!
22. You have only **one** way to become a saint: God’s grace and your will (1 Cor 15:10). God’s grace is never in shortage, do you have enough will?
23. You have only **one** reward: God (Matthew 25:21,23; 2 Tim 4:7-8). When the Lord asked Thomas Aquinas: "You have written so well about me, what reward do you want?" - "I want only God!"
24. You have **one** fatherland.

## After jail

After release, he was allowed to stay at the bishop office in Hanoi, but was not allowed to carry out his religious duties. [[ref]](https://vntaiwan.catholic.org.tw/02viet/viet56.htm)

In September 1991, he travelled to Rome to seek medical attention for his disease in Rome. While in Rome, the Vietnamese government declared that Thuan was banned from re-entrance to Vietnam. He lived in Rome since.

In 1994, Thuan resigned from the position of vice-archbishop of Saigon, and was appointed by the Vatican to be the vice-president of the Holy See's Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. He taught and presented at many places, including a cathedral in Paris, Catholic universities, an event in Mexico (May 1998) with more than 50k participants, the USA.

Pope John Paul II invited Francis Thuan to conduct the homily for the preparatory lenten service in Rome in the first mass in the third millennium, 2000. The topic was: the testimony of hope. The content was then written into a book, and the book was published.

Quoting from his book, as Pope John Paul II has expressed his trust in the experience that Thuan had, in his letter to Thuan,

> Hiền Ðệ đã dựa vào Kinh Thánh và giáo huấn của các Giáo Phụ, cũng như trên kinh nghiệm bản thân mà Hiền Ðệ thủ đắc đặc biệt khi bị cầm tù vì Chúa Kitô và Giáo Hội của Người, Hiền Ðệ đã làm nổi bật sức mạnh của Lời Chúa, Lời mà, đối với các môn đệ của Chúa Kitô, vốn là “sức mạnh của niềm tin, là lương thực cho tâm hồn, và là nguồn mạch tinh khiết và trường cửu cho đời sống thiêng liêng của họ”
>
> You have drawn from the Scripture and the teachings of the Church, as well as your own experience that you have acquired when imprisoned because of Christ and his Church, you have highlighted the power of the Gospel of the Lord, the Word which, for the disciples, is the strength for the faith, the food for the soul, the pure and everlasting source of their spiritual life.

He humbly acknowledged that he was not very oratorical, but was only a past-prisoner.

> “Lạy Chúa Giêsu, con phải làm sao đây? Con không quen nói nhiều về khoa học và thần học. Chúa biết con chỉ là một cựu tù nhân”.
>
> “Hãy nói như con cảm thấy. Hãy làm như Ðức Giáo Hoàng đã bảo con. Với tâm tình khiêm tốn, đơn sơ!”
>
> "Jesus, what should I do? I am not used to talking about science and theology. You know that I am only an ex-prisoner."
>
> "Say what you feel. Do as the Pope told you. With a humble, simple heart."

He passed away in 2002.

## Concluding prayer

Personally, I am the most moved by his last message in the book of Five Loaves and Two Fish: I choose God. It encapsulates what one should believe and how one should act: that one is to choose God and listen to what He says, rather than following your own path, even when you think that it is the right way to follow God. God may have other plans that will eventually turn out much better, if you really listen to Him.

Lord Jesus,

On the path of hope for the past 2000 years,\
Your love is like a wave\
That attracted many pilgrims.\
They have loved with a vibrant love,\
Expressed through thoughts, words, deeds,\
With a soul stronger than all temptations,\
Stronger than all sufferings, stronger than death,\
They lived the word of God on earth,\
Their lives were a revolution,\
Reforming the face of the Church.

Looking at those shining examples,\
Since childhood I have had a wish:\
To dedicate my life completely,\
The only life I have,\
To a lasting ideal that will never collapse.\
And I am determined.

If we do Your will,\
Then You will finish it,\
I will commit myself to this miraculous adventure.\
I have chosen You,\
And I will never regret.

I heard You tell me:\
"Abide in me, in my love."\
How can I abide in another person?\
Only Your love can do miracles.\
I understand that You wants my whole life:\
"All for the love of God."

I follow Your every step on the road of hope:\
Wandering step to the stable in Bethlehem,\
Nervous step to hiding in Egypt,\
Anxious step returning to Nazareth,\
Excited step into the Temple with Mary and Joseph,\
Laborous step working for thirty years,\
Loving step preaching the Gospel for three years,\
Restless step searching for lost sheep,\
Sorrowful step into Jerusalem filled with tears,\
Lonely step into the court without any follower,\
Humiliating step carrying the cross to the Calvary,\
Failure step buried into the grave,\
With no money, no silver,\
No clothes, no friend,\
Even the Father seemed to have forsaken You,\
But You entrusted everything into the Father.

Lord, kneeling before the tabernacle,\
Alone with you,\
I finally understand:\
I cannot choose another way,\
Other ways are more comfortable,\
Other ways are more glorious,\
But they are without You, my eternal Friend,\
My only Friend throughout my life.\
In You is heaven with the Trinity,\
All earth with all mankind.\
Your suffering is mine,\
Mine, the misery of the souls by your side,\
Mine, all that is not peaceful, joyful, beautiful, happy, lovely ...\
Mine, all that is sorrow, disappointment, separation, abandonment, misery ...\
Which is Yours, because You have borne it all;\
Which is in my brothers, because You are in them;

I believe firmly,\
Because You have risen in triumph:\
"Be courageous, for I have overcome the world."

For You taught me:\
Take giant steps,\
"Go around the world and preach the Gospel."\
I will wipe the tears of sorrow\
And the hearts of discouragement.\
I will gather\
The souls that are far apart;\
I will burn the world with the fire of love,\
Burning up all that should be destroyed.\
Leaving only truth, justice, and love.

But God! I know I am weak!\
Help me abandon selfishness, comfort-loving.\
Let me not fear hardship and torment,\
that make me unworthy of being Your disciple;\
Let me be ready to take risks,\
Going against the wisdom of the world;\
I want to be the "crazy child"\
Of You, Mother Mary and St Joseph;\
I want to put myself into challenges,\
Accepting all consequences,\
Because You have taught me to risk my life.\
If You teach me to lie forever on the cross,\
Or enter the silent tabernacle until the end of the world,\
I still want to risk my life to follow.\
I will lose everything,\
But You are still there!\
Your love is still there!\
Flooding my heart,\
To love all.\
And with that I am content.\
Therefore I repeat:\
"I choose You!\
I only want You!\
I only want to glorify You."
