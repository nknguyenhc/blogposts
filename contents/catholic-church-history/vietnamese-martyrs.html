But we can easily find evidence of His word in the stories of the martyrs: many of them lost ties with their family, friends, neighbours, etc, even their own life. Following Christ means prioritising God over anything else.</p> <p>Over the course of the history, many Vietnamese Catholics were jailed and tried for their faith. Many refused to give up their faith, and as a result, were executed. Estimates show that there are in total around 100,000 Catholics executed. 117 out of them were canonized as saints. <a href="https://hdgmvietnam.com/chi-tiet/tom-luoc-tieu-su-cac-thanh-tu-dao-viet-nam-31171">[ref]</a></p> <h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context<a href="#historical-context" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h2> <h3 id="pre-colonialism">Pre-colonialism<a href="#pre-colonialism" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>Catholicism in Vietnam dated back all the way in 1500s. At the time, Vietnam was in a civil war, between the North and the South. Christianity was not really well-received among the Vietnamese people, partly because of the language barrier between the Western missionaries and the Vietnamese. <a href="https://tgpsaigon.net/bai-viet/cuoc-hoi-nhap-van-hoa-cua-giao-hoi-cong-giao-viet-nam-1533-2019-58836">[ref]</a></p> <p>The North welcomed the evangelization, even allowed missionaries to preach in the palace. This was because the Northern lords wanted to establish a trade relation with the Portuguese. <a href="http://bantongiao.snv.kontum.gov.vn/thuong-thuc-ton-giao/TIM-HIEU-VE-QUA-TRINH-DU-NHAP-VA-PHAT-TRIEN--DAO-CONG-GIAO-O-VIET-NAM-1382">[ref]</a></p> <p>Persecution of Catholics happened at the district level. At the time, the majority of Vietnamese followed folk religions, where polygamy was allowed, and worship of ancestors was a must. This contradicts the teaching of Christianity, which promotes monogamy and discourages one from bowing to ancestors. Many saw Christianity as a heresy.</p> <p>In the 1700s, the country was reunited by king Nguyen Hue (reign name Quang Trung). His dynasty was considered one of strongest in Vietnam:</p> <ul><li>Defended against the Siam invasion in the South.</li> <li>Defended against the Manchu invasion in the North.</li></ul> <p>Under his reign, he allowed Christianity to thrive. However, there were some exceptions: <a href="https://www.nguoitinhuu.org/martyrs/tudao12.html">[ref]</a></p> <ul><li>In 1785, Nguyen Nhac, Nguyen Hue's brother, ordered to plunder Catholic villages. The order was retracted shortly after.</li> <li>Nguyen Hue ordered the arrest 2 foreign priests due to political suspicions.</li></ul> <p>Nguyen Hue's son, Canh Thinh, after taking the throne upon his father's death, ordered the persecution of Catholics.</p> <h3 id="threat-of-colonialism-and-amp-french-s-attack">Threat of colonialism &amp; French's attack<a href="#threat-of-colonialism-and-amp-french-s-attack" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>A new monarchy (Nguyen dynasty) was set up in 1802. The French somewhat helped Nguyen Anh (Gia Long) to gain control from Nguyen Hue. <a href="https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quan_h%E1%BB%87_gi%E1%BB%AFa_Nguy%E1%BB%85n_%C3%81nh_v%C3%A0_ng%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Di_Ph%C3%A1p">[ref]</a> Gia Long was not fond of Catholicism, but had the obligation to keep Catholicism free in Vietnam. Before death, he cautioned against discrimination against Catholics, as that would cause social instability. The conflict with Catholicism mainly stemmed from polygamy practices at the time in Vietnam, but Catholicism enforces monogamy.</p> <ul><li>Catholics must obtain permission to rebuild old churches</li> <li>Catholics were not allowed to build new churches.</li></ul> <p>Second king of the monarchy, Minh Mang, was fully against Catholicism and ordered persecution of Catholics. He was dubbed the &quot;Nero of Vietnam&quot; due to his aggressive policies towards Catholics. <a href="https://nghiencuulichsu.com/2018/11/30/nha-nguyen-han-che-su-phat-trien-cua-thien-chua-giao-1802-1884/">[ref]</a></p> <ul><li>Did not believe in the existence of heaven</li> <li>Saw (Catholics) not bowing to ancestors as a serious crime.</li></ul> <p>His policies were more to force Catholics to give up their faith than to execute Catholics.</p> <p>Third king of the monarchy, Thieu Tri, was more relaxed towards Catholicism. He gave into many French's demands to release Catholic prisoners. His views towards Catholics was: it was a vector of invasion from Western countries. He was afraid that, in a similar manner to the Chinese opium war, after giving into demands to release Catholic prisoners, they might follow with demands for free trade of opium.</p> <p>Fourth king of the monarchy, Tu Duc, was the most aggressive towards Catholics, mainly due to the threat of colonialism. Catholics were seen as working for the French.</p> <ul><li>Foreign priests were executed without trial</li> <li>Vietnamese Catholics were allowed to step over the cross to avoid execution</li></ul> <p>When the French attacked, some Catholics joined forces with the French, bolstering his claim that Catholics were working for the French. However, many Catholics signed up to join the Vietnamese military to fight against the French.</p> <p>French battleships approached the shores of Da Nang in 1857, and war broke out in 1858. During this time (1857 - 1862), the Nguyen dynasty was the most active in hunting down and persecuting Vietnamese Catholics.</p> <h3 id="the-end-of-persecution">The end of persecution<a href="#the-end-of-persecution" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>French attacked Vietnam in 1858.

The seminary he was in had to be disbanded due to social uncertainties. However, catechism still continued.

In many occassions, he did not tag along his seminarians to avoid them being arrested.

Vietnam declared war on France in 1946. The war ended in 1954 with the Geneva accords, which split the country into 2 halves, both were to hold democratic elections to decide their own leader, with the communists governing the North.</p> <p>Thadeus Le Huu Tu was appointed bishop in Ninh Binh in 1945, which received congratulations from Ho Chi Minh. Ho Chi Minh expressed his trust in Huu Tu that he would guide Catholics into contributing to the independence of Vietnam. His diocese became a place of shelter for many during the war. <a href="https://phatdiem.org/cac-duc-giam-muc-tien-nhiem/chan-dung-tieu-su-duc-cha-anselmo-tadeo-le-huu-tu.html">[ref]</a></p> <p>On July 1, 1949, Communists in China took over the country. On July 13, 1949, pope Pius XII issued a <strong>papal decree</strong>, banning any collaboration between communists and Catholics, excommunicating Catholics that are in communist parties. He believed that communists in Vietnam are &quot;little by little&quot; showing their true colour of atheism, who would sooner or later carry out systematic persecution of Vietnamese Catholics. <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/july-13/pope-pius-xii-excommunicates-communist-catholics-decree">[ref]</a> <a href="https://indochine.uqam.ca/en/historical-dictionary/1534-vatican.html">[ref]</a></p> <p>On November 9, 1952, the bishops in Indochina issued a joint letter, where they warned Catholics of the lure of communists. At the core of communism is Marxism - Leninism, which views materials as humans' end goal, and hence is atheistic by its nature. While it puts in efforts to establish offices of governance for Catholics, those are nothing but to serve their purposes, possibly to identify and persecute Catholics. <a href="https://luongtamconggiao.wordpress.com/2010/11/03/th%C6%B0-chung-cac-gm-dong-d%C6%B0%C6%A1ng-1951-va-th%C6%B0-chung-cac-gm-mi%E1%BB%81n-nam-1960/">[ref]</a></p> <p>During the war, the Catholic attitude towards the communists and French were mixed.

Many Catholics migrated to the South.</p> <p>The North Vietnamese government started focusing on internal affairs. In 1955, the North Vietnamese government issued a decree guaranteeing religious freedom, and prohibited any state interference with religious activities. <a href="https://vanban.chinhphu.vn/default.aspx?pageid=27160&amp;docid=1097">[ref]</a> This was one of their efforts to retain Catholics in the North.</p> <p>Ngo Dinh Diem corrupted the election promised in the Geneva accord to set up his own dictatorship. The US supported Diem, and the North tried to regain control of the South, leading to the civil/American war. Initially, the US sent military advisors, weapons, and economic aid. It later escalated to sending troops in 1964.</p> <ul><li>The South was the main front of battle, mainly via insurgence (guerilla) attacks. The North was heavily bombed by US planes.</li> <li>&quot;Tet 1968&quot; (Lunar New Year of 1968) marked the most significant event, where the North attempted a total attack on the South. While it was a tactical failure from the North, it was after this moment that the anti Vietnam war sentiment peaked in the US.</li> <li>1973, the US attempted to bomb the North to totally destroy its infrastructure. However, many of the US' B52 aircrafts were shot down. The campaign was considered a disaster for the US. After the campaign, the US and North Vietnam signed the Paris accord, by which the US had to withdraw troops from the South.</li> <li>1975, the country reunited under the communist rule.</li></ul> <p>The North Vietnamese government conducted <strong>collectivisation</strong> (land reform) in 1955 - 1956. Many rich land owners were imprisoned and executed. The communists made multiple false accusations, which were then corrected shortly after. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/articles/crlrzzj9pr3o">[ref]</a> <a href="https://thinhvuongvietnam.com/Content/cai-cach-ruong-dat-sau-khi-mien-bac-duoc-giai-phong-222323">[ref]</a> While this brought about disasters for many Vietnamese (not just Catholics), this topic is barely mentioned in current history textbooks, at most it is skimmed through.</p> <p>For Catholics, many churches, schools and seminaries were disbanded as a result. Many priests were imprisoned and executed. Seminarians did not have the right conditions to be educated. Many priests were ordained in secret. <a href="https://vntaiwan.catholic.org.tw/ghvienam/lichsu3.htm">[ref]</a></p> <h4 id="1975-onwards">1975 onwards<a href="#1975-onwards" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Upon reunification, the Vietnamese government implemented re-education camps, where those affiliated with the South Vietnamese government were jailed, to be &quot;re-educated&quot; about the communist and nationalist ideologies. Many prominent figures in the past South Vietnamese government and soldiers were sent to re-education camps.</p> <p>Many churches were destroyed upon reunification. Religious schools were totally banned. Many then-Catholic schools were confiscated and reused by the government. The government also imposed strict controls of religious facilities and activities. <a href="https://lawnet.vn/vb/Nghi-quyet-297-CP-chinh-sach-ton-giao-454B.html">[ref]</a> This includes Catholic churches, nurseries, and the appointment of bishops.</p> <p>The Vietnamese government interfered with many Catholic activities.</p> <ul><li>In 1975, cardinal Francis Nguyen Van Thuan, archbishop of Saigon, was forced to resign from his position.

The Vietnamese government accused the Vatican of canonizing those martyrs with political motives, claiming that those Catholics fought for the French against Vietnamese independence. The government advised all Vietnamese against attending the canonization mass. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-06-20-mn-3521-story.html">[ref]</a></li></ul> <p>In 1979, cardinal Joseph Maria Trinh Van Can made efforts to communicate with the Vietnamese governments to establish the board of bishops in Vietnam.
