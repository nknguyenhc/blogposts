However, bishops cannot declare doctrines on their own, rather, only when they are in union with the Catholic Church that their words can be taken to be infallible.</p> <p>This is clearly defined in <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_1998_professio-fidei_en.html">the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, canon 750</a></p> <blockquote><p>¬ß 1. Those things are to be believed by divine and catholic faith which are contained in the word of God as it has been written or handed down by tradition, that is, in the single deposit of faith entrusted to the Church, and which are at the same time proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn Magisterium of the Church, or by its ordinary and universal Magisterium, which in fact is manifested by the common adherence of Christ‚Äôs faithful under the guidance of the sacred Magisterium. All are therefore bound to avoid any contrary doctrines.</p> <p>¬ß 2. Furthermore, each and everything set forth definitively by the Magisterium of the Church regarding teaching on faith and morals must be firmly accepted and held; namely, those things required for the holy keeping and faithful exposition of the deposit of faith; therefore, anyone who rejects propositions which are to be held definitively sets himself against the teaching of the Catholic Church.</p></blockquote> <p>One question that one might have is,</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-danger" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-times" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec>Wasn't the teaching of infallibility only defined in 1870, which has no apostolic backing?</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>At first, this seems like the teaching of infallibility has no basis, and is a circular argument. However, 1870 is when only the term of infallible teaching was defined - <strong>ex cathedra</strong>. The teachings of the Church has been being held infallible since the start of Church, not only since ex cathedra was defined. It is only when the papal infallibility was called into question that the doctrine was defined.</p> <p>From the definition of papal infallibility, we can see that the pope is not infallible in many aspects. In fact, errors made by the pope in other areas does not compromise his infallibility in teachings of divinely revealed truths and faith and morals.</p> <h3 id="pope-s-personal-life">Pope's personal life<a href="#pope-s-personal-life" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>Popes are by no means perfect in their personal lives. We see that even Peter was not perfect in his life, while his teachings can still be held infallible.</p> <h4 id="pope-stephen-vi">Pope Stephen VI<a href="#pope-stephen-vi" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Formosus was a bishop in Porto-Santa Rufina (a region in Italy), and was sent as a legate in Bulgaria. He was so successful that Bulgarian ruler Boris I asked the then-pope to appoint Formosus as the bishop of Bulgaria. The request was not accepted as that would violate fifteenth canon of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a>.</p> <p>Afterwards, the new pope John VIII excommunicated with Formosus, accusing him of corrupting the minds of Bulgarians that they would not accept any other bishop. According to rumours, Formosus begged for forgiveness, in exchange he would forgo his bishop office and live as a layman. Formosus then became the next pope.</p> <p>Formosus supported (Carolingian) Arnulf, who invaded Rome. Formosus crowned him to oppose Lambert. Lambert re-entered Rome afterwards, and forced the next pope Stephen VI to conduct the trial of ex-pope Formosus.</p> <p>In the Cadaver synod, Stephen VI exhumed and tried Pope Formosus' corpse, his predecessor. Stephen VI accused him of perjury, and the corpse of pope Formosus could not respond to his questioning. Pope Stephen VI then displayed his corpse through Rome and finally dumped the corpse in Tiber River. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod">[ref]</a></p> <h4 id="pope-john-xii">Pope John XII<a href="#pope-john-xii" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>He led a &quot;depraved&quot; and &quot;worldly&quot; life, where his Lateran Palace was described as a brothel.</p> <p>He was also a prince of Rome. His enemies used this to blacken his reputation.</p> <p>In Synod of Rome 963, John XII was accused of sacrilege, simony, perjury, murder, adultery, and incest, and was summoned in writing to defend himself. <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08426b.htm">[ref]</a></p> <p>According to rumours, John died during an act of adultery.</p> <p>He also made an oath with Otto I that he will only support him, not Adalbert. Out of fear for Otto I, John conspired against him and supported Adalbert.</p> <h4 id="pope-benedict-ix">Pope Benedict IX<a href="#pope-benedict-ix" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Pope Benedict IX was the only pope known for selling the papacy. Benedict offered his godfather, John Gratian, if John would reimburse Benedict with his election expenses. The deal went through, and John was eventually elected as pope, Gregory VI.</p> <p>He then even attempted to reclaim the papal office twice. <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02429a.htm">[ref]</a></p> <h4 id="alexander-vi">Alexander VI<a href="#alexander-vi" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Alexander VI was father of several children by his mistresses. Some were even officially recognised: Juan, Cesare, Jofr√©, and Lucrezia <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-VI">[ref]</a></p> <p>He also engaged in nepotism:</p> <ul><li>Teenage son Cesare was made a cardinal</li> <li>Juan was made duke of Gandia (Spain)</li></ul> <h4 id="my-response">My response<a href="#my-response" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Popes are only guaranteed to be infallible in their teachings not their life. In fact, Peter denied Jesus 3 times when Jesus was tried. Though Peter believed in the salvation for the Gentiles, he did not fully practice what he said, as we will see in Paul's confrontation with Peter. More details are included in the section on <a href="#peter">Peter</a>. Such Peter's actions do not undermine his authority to teach definitively, and similar to the current pope and the magisterium.</p> <h3 id="pope-s-personal-opinion">Pope's personal opinion<a href="#pope-s-personal-opinion" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>Pope's teachings are considered infallible only when he invokes the power of the Church, not in his personal letters or personal words. There are many incidents where the pope talked of the wrong teaching. However, in such cases, the pope never invoked the authority of the chair of Peter.</p> <h4 id="pope-honorius-i">Pope Honorius I<a href="#pope-honorius-i" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Pope Honorius I was condemned for not condemning monothelitism, which says that Jesus only has one will (one nature) - i.e. only divine will, not human will. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Honorius_I">[ref]</a></p> <p>Sergius was the Patriarch (Bishop) of Constantinople. Sergius wrote a letter to pope Honorius I, asking for his opinion on monothelitism. In his letter to Sergius, pope Honorius replied:</p> <ul><li>He praised Sergius for dropping the term &quot;one nature&quot;.</li> <li>He advised him not to speak of the term &quot;two nature&quot;, as this can be confused with Nestorian, which says Jesus was two distinct persons: one divine and one human.</li></ul> <p>Pope Honorius' reply was not a declaration of faith or dogma, and did not claim to speak with the papal authority.</p> <p>Sergius went further to tell people to confess one will in Jesus, and avoid the terms, declaring it &quot;truly agreeing with the Apostolic preaching.&quot; By which time, Honorius was already dead.</p> <p>Pope St Agatho then later used the authority as successor of Peter, and the Third council of Constantinople, to condemn monothelitism, and declared two natures. In the same letter, pope Honorius I was anathematized (excommunicated). <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07452b.htm">[ref]</a></p> <h4 id="pope-zozimus">Pope Zozimus<a href="#pope-zozimus" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Bishops in Africa condemned Pelagius for his heresies, so he sent his profession of faith, first time by a servant, second time in a letter, to pope Zozimus. Pope Zozimus did not find anything wrong with the profession, and so instructed those bishops in Africa against Pelagius to appear in Rome for further investigation.</p> <p>However, in reality, Pelagius,</p> <ul><li>denied the original sin, and</li> <li>taught that God's grace was not necessary for good works, and hence God's grace was not necessary for salvation.</li></ul> <p>What Pelagius exactly included in his exchange with pope Zozimus could not be verified.</p> <p>Pope Zozimus' actions outraged the bishops in Africa, as they considered the controversy to have been closed by the previous pope Innocent I. Zozimus then backed down, explaining that he had not settled the matter definitively, and wished to consult the African bishops further on the matter. The bishops provided Zozimus with additional evidence against Pelagius, after which the pope condemned Pelagius.</p> <h4 id="my-response-2">My response<a href="#my-response-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>In both of the cases above, we see that the pope only made errors in his personal actions or letters. However, the pope, and the magisterium in general, did not make doctrinal errors when speaking with the authority of the Church. Pope's personal opinions in no way undermine the authority of the papal office.</p> <h3 id="judgement-on-science">Judgement on science<a href="#judgement-on-science" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>The church is not responsible for teaching science. And contrary to popular belief, the Catholic Church as a whole does not assert any scientific statement.</p> <h4 id="geocentrism-vs-heliocentrism">Geocentrism vs Heliocentrism<a href="#geocentrism-vs-heliocentrism" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>The church previously approved of the idea of geocentrism, i.e. the Earth is the center of the universe, and the Sun rotates around the Earth. This in part is due to the literal interpretation of the Bible. In fact, many verses in the Bible, if taken literally, suggests that the Earth should be the center of rotation, and should not move around another object.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-info" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-info" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>Joshua 10:13</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>&quot;Sun, stand thou still at Gibeon,<br data-v-474166ec>
and thou Moon in the valley of Ai'jalon.&quot;<br data-v-474166ec>
And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,<br data-v-474166ec>
until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.</p> <p data-v-474166ec>Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.</p> <p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>Psalms 93:2</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>Yea, the world is established; it shall never be moved;<br data-v-474166ec>

and hastens to the place where it rises.</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>However, the more compelling reason was because, the church simply reiterates what Ptolemy and Aristotle had asserted in the past. The Catholic Church never asserted that only geocentrism was correct.</p> <p>Copernicus first proposed the idea of heliocentrism, i.e. the Sun is the centre of the universe, and the Earth rotated around the Sun. It was then verified by Galileo's experiments with his new telescope.</p> <p>For the record, Martin Luther was even more against the theory than the Catholic Church, which was the reason why Galileo shared his findings with the Catholic Church rather than the Protestant church. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1031319-there-is-talk-of-a-new-astrologer-nicolaus-copernicus-who">[ref]</a> . &quot;However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth.&quot; <a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/luther-calvin-and-copernicus-reformed-approach-science-and-scripture">[ref]</a></p> <p>Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, a Jesuit, fearing the opposition from traditional scientists, who believed in geocentrism, forbade Galileo from defending heliocentrism, but did not forbid him from conjecturing it. <a href="https://www.famous-trials.com/galileotrial/1018-keyfigures">[ref]</a></p> <p>Pope Urban VIII was interested in Galileo's theory. He gave his viewpoint to Galileo, that God could do anything, regardless of the laws of Physics. Galileo then quoted the pope on this to criticise the pope, saying that the pope used the Lord as explanation to everything because of his ignorance. The pope then ordered the arrest of Galileo. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-galileo-controversy">[ref]</a></p> <h4 id="flat-earth-theory">Flat Earth theory<a href="#flat-earth-theory" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Have you heard of the following ideas: in the Medieval time, many seafarers did not make it back, because, the Catholic Church asserted, that they fell off the edges of the Earth?</p> <p>Perhaps you have not. But I have heard this many times when I studied history in Vietnam.</p> <p>However, this is a total myth. For a very long time, the Catholic Church actually held onto the belief that the Earth is spherical. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/is-flat-earth-belief-biblical">[ref]</a> <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/catholic-church-and-galileo-2643">[ref]</a> In fact, many scientists in the past have held on to the belief that the Earth was round, not just the Catholic Church. It was only in the 19th century that the Fundamentalist movement raise the idea of the flat Earth, claiming that it is suggested in the Bible, with the phrase &quot;four corners of the earth.&quot;</p> <p>The myth also came from many writings that exaggerated Medieval ignorance of the round Earth, to highlight the conflict between science and religion, particularly writings by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Life_and_Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus</a>, and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1185/1185-h/1185-h.htm">John William Draper, History of the Conflict between Religion and Science</a>. But this myth is in no way true.</p> <h4 id="my-response-3">My response<a href="#my-response-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>We see that the Catholic Church never actually made an infallible teachings on the topics of science. The Catholic Church was never in a position to declare which scientific statements should be correct and which should not.</p> <p>In the case of geocentrism vs heliocentrism, the Catholic Church was involved in the controversy only because it could face the truth better than the Protestant church. In the case of flat Earth theory, it was a total myth, as the Catholic Church never subscribed to the idea.</p> <h2 id="the-apostles">The apostles<a href="#the-apostles" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h2> <p>Jesus has given the apostles the authority to teach infallibly.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>Matthew 18:17-18</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

And with him the rest of the Jews acted insincerely, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their insincerity. But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, &quot;If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>However, his actions in no way undermine his infallible teaching of salvation for the Gentiles.</p> <p>Popes are not necessarily the most virtuous people, who lead perfect lives.

And God sent an angel to Cornelius, a Gentile centurion, to tell him to invite Peter to his house.

But when the servants and soldier sent by Cornelius to Peter, and Peter was invited to Cornelius' place, getting the opportunity to preach the Gospel, Peter finally understood the vision. Even though the Gentiles are not circumcised, which was necessary at the time according to the Jewish traditions, Peter preached the Good News to them and ordered them to be baptised in the name of Jesus.

As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?&quot; When they heard this they were silenced.

And in fact, the Gentiles, too, received the gift of the Holy Spirit to speak of God.</p> <p>Later on, in the book of Acts, another discussion popped up among the apostles, as for whether the Gentiles need to be circumcised.

And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>The grace of God is the one saving the Gentiles, not circumcision. Some other apostles, Paul, Barnabas, James, then ratified Peter's view. The council eventually sent a letter to the Gentiles to assure them that they have no greater burden than keeping their works, implying that circumcision was not necessary. I would recommend you to read Acts 15 in full to get better details of the council of Jerusalem.</p> <p>In short, Peter had many times exercised his authority as the pope.

However, the pope still has to approve of the works of the council in order for it to be declared ecumenical. In each council, the decree could be made by the council as a whole, and does not need to be made specifically by the pope.</p> <p>There are instances where the council is not declared ecumenical because of the pope's final say. In <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05495a.htm">the second council of Ephesus</a>, all bishops agreed on a heresy, but only the pope rejected the decision. The council was therefore declared not ecumenical.</p> <p>The council involved violence, with many opponents of Monophysitism being excommunicated from the council.

In fact, the apostles and Peter themselves are not perfect in their lives. The Catholic Church has been granted the gift of the Holy Spirit to never fall away from the truth. Whenever the pope speaks ex cathedra, or when a council is declared ecumenical, doctrines declared are safe to be considered infallible. The Catholic Church is the church that Jesus founded before He left, with the pope being the head of the Church.</p> <p>The Catholic Church has a long history of intellectual pursuits, which are concluded from the councils. It is through thousands of years of discussions that the Catholic Church has the current set of doctrines. Many of them can be explained, while some are arguable. But remember that, they are the ones with the best knowledge of the Church, of the Bible, of how one should interpret passages. Personally, I have found many instances where the Church's knowledge of the Bible passages in Greek helps me get the correct understanding. In a way, as I am sharing my knowledge about Catholic faith, I am standing on shoulders of giants.</p> <p>Some of you might wonder, aren't there too many doctrines to follow? Should we just stick to the Bible only? I would compare the Catholic church to the body of scientists. Many laws of Physics took years, even centuries, to be proven correct, and as we learn them in school, we are ignorant of how much sweat has gone into proving them. And that is how one should learn science! At times, people with curious mind would want to find out the proof of some theorems. But we should never break away from the complex body of science and say, we should stick to our own observations! That is how the modern flat Earth theory is formed. Flat Earthers stick to their own theories and observations to argue against the common belief of the round Earth. Similarly, the Church has been built upon centuries of intellectual pursuit. I as a Catholic may not know all doctrines, and may fully understand even fewer. But that is how I will commit as a Christian! I believe that the Catholic Church teaches correct doctrines. I at times may question the doctrines, and take time to find the answer. But I will never break away from the true church that Jesus has founded.</p></div> <nav id="page-nav" data-v-e6005420><div class="nav-component slim-scroll" data-v-e6005420><a class="navbar-brand page-nav-title" href="#" data-v-e6005420>Papal Infallibility</a> <nav id="mb-page-nav" class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 small no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#overview" data-v-e6005420>Overview‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-s-personal-life" data-v-e6005420>Pope's personal life‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-stephen-vi" data-v-e6005420>Pope Stephen VI‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-john-xii" data-v-e6005420>Pope John XII‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-benedict-ix" data-v-e6005420>Pope Benedict IX‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#alexander-vi" data-v-e6005420>Alexander VI‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#my-response" data-v-e6005420>My response‚Äé</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-s-personal-opinion" data-v-e6005420>Pope's personal opinion‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-honorius-i" data-v-e6005420>Pope Honorius I‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-zozimus" data-v-e6005420>Pope Zozimus‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#my-response-2" data-v-e6005420>My response‚Äé</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#judgement-on-science" data-v-e6005420>Judgement on science‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#geocentrism-vs-heliocentrism" data-v-e6005420>Geocentrism vs Heliocentrism‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#flat-earth-theory" data-v-e6005420>Flat Earth theory‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#my-response-3" data-v-e6005420>My response‚Äé</a></nav></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#the-apostles" data-v-e6005420>The apostles‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#peter" data-v-e6005420>Peter‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#peter-the-vicar-of-christ" data-v-e6005420>Peter, the vicar of Christ‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#imperfect-peter" data-v-e6005420>Imperfect Peter‚Äé</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#peter-s-authority" data-v-e6005420>Peter's authority‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#peter-exercised-his-authority" data-v-e6005420>Peter exercised his authority‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#early-christian-views-towards-peter" data-v-e6005420>Early Christian views towards Peter‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#but-peter-was-just-a-fellow-elder" data-v-e6005420>But Peter was just a fellow elder‚Äé</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#magisterium" data-v-e6005420>Magisterium‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#the-councils" data-v-e6005420>The councils‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#pope-s-attendance" data-v-e6005420>Pope's attendance‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#western-schism" data-v-e6005420>Western schism‚Äé</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#papal-succession" data-v-e6005420>Papal succession‚Äé</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e6005420><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#structure-of-church" data-v-e6005420>Structure of Church‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#early-church-s-view" data-v-e6005420>Early Church's View‚Äé</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#church-union" data-v-e6005420>Church union‚Äé</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#concluding-words" data-v-e6005420>Concluding words‚Äé</a> <!----></nav></div> <!----></nav> <div aria-hidden="true" class="scroll-top-button fa-lg d-print-none" style="display:none;bottom:2%;right:2%;position:fixed;"><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></div></div> <footer><div class="text-center"><small>[Generated by <a href="https://markbind.org/">MarkBind 5.6.0</a>]</small></div></footer></div>
