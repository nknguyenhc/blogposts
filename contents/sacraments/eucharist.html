Manna from heaven, during Moses' time
</span></span> <p>When talking about the bread from heaven, Jesus has declared that He is the bread of life.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>John 6:35</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>Jesus said to them, &quot;I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>Arguably, it can be understood as, his words are to be taken as food for the soul. It is harder to believe that he meant his flesh are to be taken. However, it became clear that Jesus meant it literally, not figuratively, when the Jews were confused by what he said.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>John 6:52</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, &quot;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>It is hard to accept the fact that Jesus actually gave his flesh for us to eat. And indeed, at that point of time, it is difficult for the Jews to understand what He said, given that the Eucharist has not been instituted. So instead of explaining what could not be explained, Jesus reiterated his point.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>John 6:53-58</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>So Jesus said to them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever.&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>We see that Jesus reiterated his point multiple times, that we are to eat His flesh and drink His blood. <strong>It is not optional to believe, nor optional to receive the Eucharist, it is <em>necessary</em> for eternal life.</strong></p> <p>So, you might be wondering, why can we be so sure that his word is to be taken literally, and not in any figurative meaning? Well, if we look at the original text in Greek, we see that, the word used for &quot;flesh&quot; is <code class="hljs inline no-lang">sarx</code>, and the word used for &quot;body&quot; is <code class="hljs inline no-lang">soma</code>. These two words are to be understood in their literal sense, as St Paul has used them interchangeably in many other instances in the Bible to mean the literal &quot;flesh&quot;. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/if-you-eat-my-flesh-you-eat-my-body">[ref]</a></p> <p>The word used for &quot;eat&quot; in this passage is <code class="hljs inline no-lang">trogon</code>, which means literally &quot;chewing&quot; and &quot;gnawing.&quot; Furthermore, there is a problem with interpreting this passage figuratively: when used figuratively among the Jews, it means to inflict serious injuries upon a person. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/christ-in-the-eucharist">[ref]</a></p> <blockquote><p>To interpret the phrase figuratively then would be to make our Lord promise life everlasting to the culprit for slandering and hating him, which would reduce the whole passage to utter nonsense.</p></blockquote> <h3 id="this-saying-is-hard">This saying is hard<a href="#this-saying-is-hard" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>Yes, it is hard to believe that Jesus actually gave his flesh and blood in the Eucharist. And many of Jesus' disciples found it hard to believe too.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>John 6:60-62</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, &quot;This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?&quot; But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, &quot;Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>He explained, it would be even harder to believe it when the apostles would see Him &quot;ascending where he was before&quot;, which means to rise from the dead and ascend to heaven. So, if we are believe in Jesus' resurrection and ascension to heaven, it should be easier for us to believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</p> <p>Jesus then followed up with this statement:</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>John 6:63</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>Did He invalidate what He had just taught? No! The word &quot;flesh&quot; here refers to the fallen human nature, not Jesus' flesh. In other words, it is the spirit that gives life, not the flesh of human. That is different from the flesh of Jesus which we must receive to gain eternal life.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>John 6:66-67</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him. Jesus said to the twelve, &quot;Will you also go away?&quot;</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>Many disciples stopped following Jesus because they could not believe that Jesus could give his flesh and blood for us to consume. If you do not believe and do not want the Eucharist, you can leave. But Jesus will not change this teaching.</p> <h2 id="preparation-for-the-eucharist">Preparation for the Eucharist<a href="#preparation-for-the-eucharist" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h2> <p>Since the Eucharist is not merely a symbol in remembrance of Christ, but the actual presence of Christ, we must prepare ourselves properly to receive the holy communion. Two conditions must be met before one can receive the Eucharist:</p> <ul><li>He must abstain from food before taking the Eucharist</li> <li>He must not have unrepentant mortal sins</li></ul> <p>To see why this is the case, let's look at the letters of St Paul.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>1 Cor 11:27-29</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.

Since mortal sins are not in alignment with Christ, we are to be free from mortal sins before receiving Christ from the Eucharist. This is especially important, as the Eucharist is not merely a symbol, it is the actual body and blood of Christ. In 1983 Code of Canon Law, it is explicitly specified that a person with unconfessed mortal sins is not to receive the Eucharist. <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib4-cann879-958_en.html#Art._2.">[ref]</a></p> <blockquote><p>A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible.</p></blockquote> <p>It remains as the final step for one to recognise his own mortal sins, and go to confession to confess his mortal sins before receiving the holy communion.</p> <div class="alert box-container alert-success" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-474166ec><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><div class="icon-wrapper" data-v-474166ec><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" data-v-474166ec></i></div> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-474166ec><p data-v-474166ec><strong data-v-474166ec>1 Cor 11:20-22</strong></p> <p data-v-474166ec>When you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p></div> <!----></div></div></div> <p>At the point of writing, there was a tradition where the people ate and drank before receiving the Eucharist, which St Paul was warning against. While from the Bible it is not a strict requirement, one should refrain from feasting before mass, to prepare oneself to receive Christ's body and blood that nourishes the soul. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/jesus-gave-the-eucharist-after-everybody-had-eaten-so-why-do-catholics-have-to-fast-before-mass">[ref]</a></p> <p>In the early days of the church, there was no recommendation as to how much to fast. In 1917, the fasting was mandated to being from the midnight before the mass. In 1957, the fasting was reduced to 3 hours. In 1964, the fasting was reduced to one hour. <a href="https://catholictimescolumbus.org/news/father-paul-keller-op-s-t-d/can-i-eat-before-mass">[ref]</a> As of current day, Catholics are required to fast at least one hour before the Eucharist, as specified in the 1983 Code of Canon Law. <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib4-cann879-958_en.html#Art._1.">[ref]</a></p> <blockquote><p>A person who is to receive the Most Holy Eucharist is to abstain for at least one hour before holy communion from any food and drink, except for only water and medicine.</p></blockquote> <h2 id="final-notes">Final notes<a href="#final-notes" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h2> <p>Most of the content from this page, on the arguments for transubstantiation, is copied from these two Youtube videos.
